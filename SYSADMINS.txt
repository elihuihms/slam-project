Notes for Sysadmins
===================

Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------

SLAM has not been tested with Windows based operating systems and likely will not work (but you're welcome to try!). SteelSnowflake LLC currently has no plans to develop such a version.

Basic Requirements
------------------

* PHP 5.2.0+ (SLAM will not install with earlier versions)
* MySQL 4.0+ (Earlier versions may work, but have not been tested).

Installation Options
--------------------

Some default options can be specified for the installer by editing the file install/defaults.ini

In particular, these fields may need to be changed:
* SLAM_FILE_ARCH_DIR - This is the directory to which the files attached to assets will be saved. This directory should be readable/writable by the PHP user. It does not need to be web accessible. SLAM will create several directories inside this folder that corresponding to different asset categories.
* SLAM_FILE_TEMP_DIR - This directory will hold files temporarily while they are being uploaded and compressed into the asset archives. Like the previous directory, it too should be readable/writable by the PHP user. It also does not need to be externally accessible.

PHP settings
------------

You may wish to edit your php.ini in order to attach files larger than the 5MB default. Specifically, you will need to find and change the following options:

* post_max_size = 100M
* upload_max_filesize = 100M

Other considerations
--------------------

SLAM has not be tested with PHP's Safe Mode. Problems are likely to be encountered when attaching asset files. If you encounter problems, please leave a trouble report ticket at SLAM's google code issue tracker at code.google.com/p/slam-project/issues
