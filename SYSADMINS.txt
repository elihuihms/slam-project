Notes for Sysadmins
===================

Supported Operating Systems
---------------------------

SLAM has not been tested with WAMP stacks, but if you get it working we'd love to hear about it.

Basic Requirements
------------------

* PHP 7.0+
* MySQL 5.0+ (Earlier versions may work, but have not been tested).

Installation Options
--------------------

Some default options can be specified for the installer by editing the file install/defaults.ini

In particular, these fields may need to be changed:
* SLAM_FILE_ARCH_DIR - This is the directory to which the files attached to assets will be saved. This directory should be readable/writable by the PHP user. It does not need to be web accessible. SLAM will create several directories inside this folder that corresponding to different asset categories.
* SLAM_FILE_TEMP_DIR - This directory will hold files temporarily while they are being uploaded and compressed into the asset archives. Like the previous directory, it too should be readable/writable by the PHP user. It also does not need to be externally accessible.

PHP settings
------------

You may wish to edit your php.ini in order to attach files larger than the 5MB default. Specifically, you will need to find and change the following options:

* post_max_size = 100M
* upload_max_filesize = 100M

Other considerations
--------------------

SLAM has not be tested with PHP's Safe Mode, problems are likely to be encountered when attaching asset files. If you encounter issues, please open an issue at SLAM's github repo, github.com/steelsnowflake/slam.
